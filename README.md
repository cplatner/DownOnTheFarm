# Down on the Farm

During the [FarmVille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FarmVille) craze on
Facebook in about 2010, I recall getting dozens of message every day from
friends who were playing at the time.  I first muted all of those messages,
but later thought of an even better revenge.  I'd write my own 'game' that
would instead return a depressing status message related to farming.  At
the time, I didn't know about [Cow Clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_Clicker),
but making fun of FarmVille was definitely the idea.

I never made the app, but recently decided to put some code behind the idea.
